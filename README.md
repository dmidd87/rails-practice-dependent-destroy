# Rails Practice

## Setup

* Fork and clone the repository
* Install gems - `bundle`
* Set up the databases - `rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`
* Start the server - `rails s`

You can run specs with:

`rspec`

Note: email/password combinations for existing users populated by `rake db:seed` can be found in the db/seeds.rb file.

## Stories

* Figure out where you should put dependent destroy and put it there.
* Add the appropraite destroy links
